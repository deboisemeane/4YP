PROJECT TITLE
Sleep Tracking Using Wearables and Deep Learning

MOTIVATION
Traditional sleep tracking sleep is expensive, time-consuming, uncomfortable.
Artificial intelligence presents an oppourtunity to improve on these methods, by allowing for automated sleep stage classification from a smaller, easier to collect subset of polysomnography data.
The aim of this project is to explore the potential for automated sleep stage classification using data collected from wearable devices.

BUILD STATUS 17/11/2023
The project currently allows for training and testing of multi-layer perceptron models on hand-crafted frequency features from the ISRUC and SHHS-1 datasets.
Future additions:
    - CNNs to learn features from time-series EEG data.
    - Data obtained from wearables to make predictions.
